     Rules for a Rail Fence Cipher
     This cipher simply scrambles the text in a particular pattern
     the text is written letter by letter down 'rails', moving up when it reaches the bottom
     the text is then read rail by rail to produce the encrypted text
     the key refers to the number of rails
