    Pig Latin is a misnomer, it has nothing to do with pigs or latin. It's a language game to make something sound strange and foreign. For words that begin with a consonant, all letters up to the first vowel are moved to the end of the word and then the ending 'ay' is added. For words that begin with a vowel the ending 'way' is added.
