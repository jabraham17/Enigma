    Enigma is an encryption app written for your protection. In this modern age, no information is safe. Enigma attempts to protect you by giving you the tools to survive in this new world. No longer are you at the mercy of the government or hackers. You are in control of your privacy. Even a simple scramble of the text is enough to make a hacker move on to a easier target. And for the more determined hacker, Enigma provides better levels of encryption.

    Enigma is a product of Rabin Apps.
