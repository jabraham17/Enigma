    The Vigenère Cipher is different from the other keyed encryptions. It is what is called a polyalphabetic cipher. This means that instead of using one alphabet described by a key, it uses many alphabets described by a key. A Vigenère Cipher is in essence a rotating Caesar Cipher, each letter is encrypted using a different key.

    The key for each letter is generated by the input keyword. The keyword is repeated so that the extended key has the same number of characters as the text to be encrypted. Then, each letter of the key is converted to a number 0-25. Each letter of the text is then encrypted based on the corresponding key using a Caesar Cipher.
